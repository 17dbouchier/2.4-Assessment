          <p>When you hear about <b>self-driving cars</b>, you probably think of the genre of science fiction. However, self-driving vehicles are very real, and are already creating a significant presence in certain parts of the world. Self-driving vehicles have been in development for over a decade, with companies such as Google and Tesla pioneering the effort. Companies such as Tesla dream of the day when all vehicles are electrically-powered, as well as autonomous. Studies have shown that self-driving cars have the potential to be significantly safer on the road compared to human drivers, and the way that these machines function is powered by artificial intelligence. <br><br><span class="paragraph-hook">The future of transport is here, with self-driving vehicles</span></p>

          <p><b>Home assistants</b> are the future of how humans will organise their days, as well as the countless other features that home assistants are already showing off in the world today. Machines such as Google Home offer a method of connecting everything within your own house, from the lightbulbs to the window shades, and linking them to one hub which controls them all. This level of connectivity would allow users to run their homes autonomously, with a Google Home watering their plants, or heating the living room to just the right temperature. Machines such as the Amazon Alexa are also reinventing the way that we shop online, with voice activated commands and curated recommendations just for you, brought to you by artificial intelligence! <br><br><span class="paragraph-hook">The future of living is now, with home assistants</span></p>
