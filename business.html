          <p>Personal assistants are machines which work to organise you, your work, and your day. The way that many personal assistants work today is simple, such as offering reminders regarding automatically scheduled appointments, or reminding you to reply to an email from a co-worker. However, the number of tasks that personal assistants are able to accomplish is growing at a rapid pace. Machines such as Google Duplex have demonstrated that an artificial intelligence will soon be able to handle creating an appointment for you over the phone, as well as other vast possibilities to improve the efficiency of your work day, just waiting to be explored.<br><br><span class="paragraph-hook">The future of your workday is here, with personal assistants</span></p>

          <p>If you use the internet often, you will have certainly run into artificial intelligence in the form of <b>curated recommendations</b>. Curated recommendations are suggestions that an intelligence believes would best suit you, based on a data profile that it has built on you. These data profiles can be built from purchase history in the case of an online shopping centre such as Amazon, or viewing history, in the case of streaming websites such as YouTube or Netflix. Curated recommendations work to improve the userâ€™s satisfaction with their overall experience, as well as helping businesses improve their sales.
